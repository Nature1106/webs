                            While using only HTML for website design might seem limited in modern web development, 
                            it does offer some distinct benifits, particularly for very simple or specific use cases like 
                            Simplicity and Ease of Learning, Fast Loading time, Universal Browser Support, Excellent for Basic 
                            Content Delivery, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) friendly, Accessibility, Cost-Effective. However using
                            only HTML means secrificing Visual Styling, Interactivity, Modern Web Design.
                            In summary, HTML alone is not sufficient for modern and interactive websites.

                            There are several ways to create a website and these can be broadly categorized into: using website builders, 
                            content management systems (CMS) or custom built sites. Website builders are user friendly, often 
                            employing drag-and-drop interfaces, while CMS platforms like WordPress offer more flexibility and customization options.
                            Custom-built websites, typically coded from scratch, provide the highest level of control but require 
                            signigicant technical expertise.
